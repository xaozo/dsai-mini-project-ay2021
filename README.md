# dsai-mini-project-ay2021

## Description
This repo archives a Data Science mini-project done for an introductory course in NTU SCBE (CB0494), in Semester 2 of AY2020-2021.
The dataset used is HDB resale flat prices (based on registration date) from Jan 2017 onwards. <br>
This repo contains the following files:
* The dataset in csv format (retrieved from https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices)
* The original notebook that was submitted for grading

## Objectives (of the original notebook)

## Credits (for the original notebook)
I would like to thank the following people, without whom the completion of this project would not have been possible:
* Ong Qi Yi, my teammate in this mini-project
* Dr. Kelvin Yong, who mentored and assessed us in this mini-project

## Future Work
Possible future directions for this analysis includes:
* Feature generation - region of flat (eg. North, North-East, Central...)
* Test whether the newly generated feature are better predictors than existing ones
