# cb0494-dsai-project

## Description
This is a Data Science mini-project done for Nanyang Technological University's CB0494 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence course, in Semester 2 of AY2020-2021.
The dataset used is HDB resale flat prices (based on registration date) from Jan 2017 onwards.
This repository contains the following files:
* The dataset in csv format (retrieved from https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices)
* The original notebook that was submitted for grading

## Objectives (of the original notebook)

## Credits (for the original notebook)
I would like to thank the following people, without whom the completion of this project would not have been possible:
* Ong Qi Yi, my teammate in this mini-project
* Dr. Kelvin Yong, who mentored and assessed us in this mini-project

## Additional Comments
Additionally, motivated by constructive criticism given on the original notebook, I worked on another notebook that explores the same dataset from an alternative and complementary perspective.
This notebook is still a work-in-progress, and will be uploaded soon.
